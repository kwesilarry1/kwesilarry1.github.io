&lt;p&gt;Do i even need an introduction? Maybe not.But even people who feel like they failed deserve to be honest about it. This is my 2025 recap in not more than 200 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="recap-of-the-year"&gt;Recap of the year&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 was not the year I wanted.
I did not become cracked or even semi-cracked in application security or bug hunting, which was my main goal.
For that reason, everything else feels small to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
