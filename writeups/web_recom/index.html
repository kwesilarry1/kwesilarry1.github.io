Before you exploit, you understand.” Manual recon is where real hackers sharpen their instincts.\nManual recon is the art of exploring a target website using your eyes, brain, and browser—without jumping straight into tools like nmap, ffuf, or Burp Intruder. It helps you understand the site like a real user (and a developer), and often reveals low-hanging bugs that automation can overlook. Before you start running automated tools, Try to uncover every feature in the application that users can access by browsing through every page and clicking every link. Access the functionalities that you don’t usually use.\nFor example: if you’re hacking Facebook, try to create an event, play a game, and use the payment functionality if you’ve never done so before. Sign up for an account at every privilege level to reveal all of the application’s features. For example, on Slack, you can create owners, admins, and members of a workspace. Also create users who are members of different channels under the same workspace. This way, you can see what the application looks like to different users. This should give you a rough idea of what the attack surface (all of the different points at which an attacker can attempt to exploit the application) looks like, where the data entry points are, and how different users interact with each other. Then you can start a more in-depth recon process: finding out the technology and structure of an application.\n🌐 Whois and Reverse Whois Lookups-Peeking Behind the Domain “Every domain has a story — and WHOIS lets you read the first chapter.”\nWHOIS is a protocol used to query domain registration information. It tells you who owns a domain, when it was registered, where it points to, and sometimes reveals admin contact emails, organization names, and related domains — a goldmine during recon.To query whois information, just simply type\nwhois [Target Site] This information is not always available, as some organizations and individuals use a service called domain privacy, in which a third-party service provider replaces the user’s information with that of a forwarding service.You could then conduct a reverse WHOIS search, searching a database by using an organization name, a phone number, or an email address to find domains registered with it. This way, you can find all the domains that belong to the same owner. Reverse WHOIS is extremely useful for finding obscure or internal domains not otherwise disclosed to the public. We can use a public reverse whois tool like ViewDNS.info to conduct this query. 🚩 Red Flags to Look Out For\nRecently registered domain - Might be used in phishing or shady activity Short TTL or temporary hosting - Signs of suspicious infrastructure Reused email/contact info - Can be tracked across domains Expiring domain - Can become vulnerable or forgotten WHOIS is your first step into the DNS layer of web reconnaissance. It’s simple, powerful, and often reveals the invisible strings that tie domains, companies, and infrastructure together.\n🧠 DNS Enumeration - Unmasking the Infrastructure “Before you can break into the castle, you map its walls, gates, and hidden tunnels — DNS is that map.”\nDNS (Domain Name System) enumeration is the process of collecting DNS records and related infrastructure data about a target. It helps identify: Subdomains, IP addresses,Email servers,Name servers,Load balancers,Misconfigured or forgotten services. First, we need to discover the IP Address of the server by using nslookup. The syntax go like:\nnslookup [Target Site] You can use query for a specific record type by specifying the type option: The record types you can query with nslookup are; Mail Servers(MX), TXT Records(TXT),Canonical Name(CNAME),IPV4 Adrresses(A),IPV6 Addresses(AAAA) etc.\nnslookup -type=Record_type [Target Site] 🌍 Shodan \u0026 Censys - Uncovering Exposed Infrastructure “If Google indexes websites, Shodan indexes the internet’s devices.”\nShodan and Censys are search engines for internet-connected devices and services.They scan and index open ports, services, SSL certs, HTTP banners, metadata, and more,Think of them as a CTO’s nightmare and a recon hacker’s best friend.They can reveal: Publicly exposed servers/devices (even if subdomains don’t exist!), Leaky metadata in HTTP headers or SSL certs,Specific tech stack in use (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Nginx, Jenkins),Misconfigurations or outdated software,IoT devices, security cams, or forgotten test servers etc. To use Shodan, go to shodan.io and type your target server in the search bar. For example: You can add advanced filters like: Other filters:\norg:“Company Name” – find all exposed infra owned by a company port:21 – exposed FTP product:“Apache” – find specific tech stack country:“US” – filter geographically Censys is similar but focuses more on certificate and IP infrastructure data, To use Censys, go to search.censys.io and type your target name in the search bar like this: Censys also have various filters like: ip – direct IP search services.http.response.body – search by response content autonomous_system.name – scan by ASN 🕵️‍♂️ Google Dorking – Hacking with Google Search “Why break in when Google left the door wide open?”\nGoogle Dorking, or Google hacking, is the art of using advanced Google search operators to find sensitive information unintentionally exposed on the internet.It’s one of the most underrated yet powerful recon techniques — you’d be surprised what you can uncover with just a browser. Some common google dorks are:\nDork Purpose site:target.com Search only within the target domain intitle:\"index of\" Discover open directories filetype:pdf site:target.com Find PDFs under the domain inurl:login Login portals and panels ext:log site:target.com Find log files intext:\"password\" filetype:txt Plaintext password leaks site:pastebin.com \"target.com\" Info leaks from Pastebin site:github.com \"target.com\" Sensitive code or API keys on GitHub link:\" Specified URL\" Pages that contain links to a specified URL You can comnbine two or more dorks depending on the information you want. For Example: To reveal admin panels or dashboards of a target site, you can use: Tips for Effective Dorking\nUse quotes to match exact phrases. Combine multiple operators to narrow results. Search on Google Cache and Wayback Machine for deleted pages. Use public tools like:Exploit-DB Google Hacking DB or Google Dork Search Engine. Active Recon Techniques 🌐 Subdomain Enumeration – Discovering the Forgotten Doors “The real vulnerabilities often live on subdomains no one remembers.”\nSubdomain enumeration is the process of discovering subdomains belonging to a target domain. These subdomains often reveal: Development or staging environments,Forgotten assets, APIs, admin panels, legacy apps,and Third-party integrations (e.g., Shopify, WordPress, Heroku).Finding them expands your attack surface, giving you more opportunities to discover misconfigurations, outdated software, or exposed credentials.(More subdomains = more chances to find bugs).\nTools that can be use for enumerating subdomains are: Sublist3r, SubBrute, Amass, Gobuster etc. Each of these tools employs a different approach to discovering subdomains, so reviewing their manual pages or documentation beforehand is recommended.\nOnce you’ve found a good number of subdomains, you can discover more by identifying patterns. For example, if you find two subdomains of target.com named 1.target.com and 3.target.com, you can guess that 2.target.com is probably also a valid subdomain. You can automate this process with a tool called Altdns.\nAnd also if you know about the company’s technology stack. For example, if you’ve already learned that target.com uses spacelift, you can check if spacelift.target.com is a valid subdomain. Also look for subdomains of subdomains. After you’ve found, say, team.target.com, you might find subdomains like 1.team.example.com. You can find subdomains of subdomains by running enumeration tools recursively: add the results of your first run to your Known Domains list and run the tool again.\n📁 Directory Brute Forcing - Discovering Hidden Paths “Not all doors are locked. Some are just hidden.”\nDirectory brute forcing is the process of guessing directories and files on a web server by sending a list of potential paths and observing the responses.It helps uncover:\nAdmin panels (/admin, /manage, etc.) API endpoints (/api/v1/, /graphql) Backup files (.zip, .bak, .old) Hidden pages (/test, /dev, /staging) Sensitive data (.env, .git, config.php) Some popular Tools for Directory Discovery: ffuf, dirsearch, gobuster, feroxbuster, dirb etc. This tools take wordlist and make request and then analyze the response.So using a good/quality wordlist is very important here, i will recommend using wordlist from Seclists or you can also customize your own list.Manually visiting all the pages you’ve found through brute-forcing can be time-consuming. Instead, use a screenshot tool like Eyewitness to automatically verify that a page is hosted on each location and also takes screenshots of each page. In a photo gallery app, you can quickly skim these to find the interesting-looking ones. 🚩 Red Flags to Watch For\nUnprotected panels (/admin, /dashboard) Exposed backups (.zip, .tar, .bak) .git or .svn folders Debug files (debug.log, info.php) Misconfigured APIs or dev endpoints Outdated and Ill-maintaned pages 🚪 Port Scanning \u0026 Service Enumeration - Finding Open Doors “Before you pick the lock, you need to find the door.”\nPort scanning is the act of probing a target to discover which network ports are open. Each open port represents a service running on the server, like: SSH(22),FTP(21),HTTP(80),HTTPS(443) etc.Identifying these services is essential for service enumeration, which reveals versions, misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities.\nTools that you can use for port scanning: Nmap(with the -sV flag), masscan,rustscan,netcat etc. After determining the services running on the system and the open ports,dive deeper into each service Once ports are open, dive deeper into each service:\nService Tools/Approach HTTP/HTTPS curl, whatweb, nikto, ffuf SSH Check banner, brute-force (with permission) FTP Anonymous login, file listings SMTP VRFY/EXPN, banner grabbing MySQL/PostgreSQL Try default creds, version check SMB enum4linux, smbclient, smbmap 🧾 Conclusion Reconnaissance is the foundation of every successful web security assessment. By thoroughly exploring the target’s surface from WHOIS data and DNS records to subdomains, directories, ports, and public infrastructure you gather the intel needed to launch precise and effective attacks.\nEach recon technique serves a purpose:\nManual walkthroughs give you the human perspective. WHOIS \u0026 DNS lookups reveal ownership and structure. Subdomain \u0026 directory brute forcing expose hidden assets. Port scanning \u0026 service enumeration uncover the digital services in play. Shodan, Censys, and Google Dorks extend your reach beyond what’s visible. In hacking, the best payload is useless if you don’t know where to point it, Recon tells you where to aim. Whether you’re doing CTFs, bug bounties, or real-world pentests, never skip recon, it often holds the keys to the kingdom.\n","wordCount":"1794","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-05-13T11:10:54Z","dateModified":"2025-05-13T11:10:54Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Appiah Bismark"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kwesilarry1.github.io/writeups/web_recom/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"0kxwizard","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kwesilarry1.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kwesilarry1.github.io/ accesskey=h title="0kxwizard (Alt + H)">0kxwizard</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

search operators to find sensitive information unintentionally exposed
on the internet.It&rsquo;s one of the most underrated yet powerful recon
techniques &mdash; you&rsquo;d be surprised what you can uncover with just a
browser. Some common google dorks are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dork</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>site:target.com</code></td><td>Search only within the target domain</td></tr><tr><td><code>intitle:"index of"</code></td><td>Discover open directories</td></tr><tr><td><code>filetype:pdf site:target.com</code></td><td>Find PDFs under the domain</td></tr><tr><td><code>inurl:login</code></td><td>Login portals and panels</td></tr><tr><td><code>ext:log site:target.com</code></td><td>Find log files</td></tr><tr><td><code>intext:"password" filetype:txt</code></td><td>Plaintext password leaks</td></tr><tr><td><code>site:pastebin.com "target.com"</code></td><td>Info leaks from Pastebin</td></tr><tr><td><code>site:github.com "target.com"</code></td><td>Sensitive code or API keys on GitHub</td></tr><tr><td><code>link:" Specified URL"</code></td><td>Pages that contain links to a specified URL</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can comnbine two or more dorks depending on the information you
want. For Example: To reveal admin panels or dashboards of a target
site, you can use: <img alt=Dorks loading=lazy src=/images/dork.png> Tips for

to a target domain. These subdomains often reveal: Development or
staging environments,Forgotten assets, APIs, admin panels, legacy
apps,and Third-party integrations (e.g., Shopify, WordPress,
Heroku).Finding them expands your attack surface, giving you more
opportunities to discover misconfigurations, outdated software, or
exposed credentials.(More subdomains = more chances to find bugs).</p><p>Tools that can be use for enumerating subdomains are: <em><strong>Sublist3r,
SubBrute, Amass, Gobuster etc.</strong></em> Each of these tools employs a
different approach to discovering subdomains, so reviewing their manual
pages or documentation beforehand is recommended.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve found a good number of subdomains, you can discover more by
identifying patterns. For example, if you find two subdomains of
<em><strong>target.com</strong></em> named <em><strong>1.target.com</strong></em> and <em><strong>3.target.com</strong></em>, you
can guess that <em><strong>2.target.com</strong></em> is probably also a valid subdomain.
You can automate this process with a tool called
<a href=https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns>Altdns</a>.</p><p>And also if you know about the company&rsquo;s technology stack. For example,
if you&rsquo;ve already learned that <em><strong>target.com</strong></em> uses <em><strong>spacelift</strong></em>,
you can check if <em><strong>spacelift.target.com</strong></em> is a valid subdomain. Also
look for subdomains of subdomains. After you&rsquo;ve found, say,
<em><strong>team.target.com</strong></em>, you might find subdomains like
<em><strong>1.team.example.com</strong></em>. You can find subdomains of subdomains by
running enumeration tools recursively: add the results of your first run
to your Known Domains list and run the tool again.</p><h3 id=-directory-brute-forcing---discovering-hidden-paths>📁 Directory Brute Forcing - Discovering Hidden Paths<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-directory-brute-forcing---discovering-hidden-paths>#</a></h3><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not all doors are locked. Some are just hidden.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Directory brute forcing is the process of guessing directories and files
on a web server by sending a list of potential paths and observing the
responses.It helps uncover:</p><ul><li>Admin panels (/admin, /manage, etc.)</li><li>API endpoints (/api/v1/, /graphql)</li><li>Backup files (.zip, .bak, .old)</li><li>Hidden pages (/test, /dev, /staging)</li><li>Sensitive data (.env, .git, config.php)</li></ul><p>Some popular Tools for Directory Discovery: ffuf, dirsearch, gobuster,
feroxbuster, dirb etc. This tools take wordlist and make request and
then analyze the response.So using a good/quality wordlist is very
important here, i will recommend using wordlist from Seclists or you can
also customize your own list.Manually visiting all the pages you&rsquo;ve
found through brute-forcing can be time-consuming. Instead, use a
screenshot tool like
<a href=https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness/>Eyewitness</a> to
automatically verify that a page is hosted on each location and also
takes screenshots of each page. In a photo gallery app, you can quickly
skim these to find the interesting-looking ones. 🚩 Red Flags to Watch

ports are open. Each open port represents a service running on the
server, like: SSH(22),FTP(21),HTTP(80),HTTPS(443) etc.Identifying these
services is essential for service enumeration, which reveals versions,
misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities.</p><p>Tools that you can use for port scanning: Nmap(with the -sV flag),
masscan,rustscan,netcat etc. After determining the services running on
the system and the open ports,dive deeper into each service Once ports
are open, dive deeper into each service:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Tools/Approach</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HTTP/HTTPS</td><td>curl, whatweb, nikto, ffuf</td></tr><tr><td>SSH</td><td>Check banner, brute-force (with permission)</td></tr><tr><td>FTP</td><td>Anonymous login, file listings</td></tr><tr><td>SMTP</td><td>VRFY/EXPN, banner grabbing</td></tr><tr><td>MySQL/PostgreSQL</td><td>Try default creds, version check</td></tr><tr><td>SMB</td><td>enum4linux, smbclient, smbmap</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=-conclusion>🧾 Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-conclusion>#</a></h2><p>Reconnaissance is the foundation of every successful web security
assessment. By thoroughly exploring the target&rsquo;s surface from WHOIS data
and DNS records to subdomains, directories, ports, and public
infrastructure you gather the intel needed to launch precise and
effective attacks.</p><p>Each recon technique serves a purpose:</p><ul><li>Manual walkthroughs give you the human perspective.</li><li>WHOIS & DNS lookups reveal ownership and structure.</li><li>Subdomain & directory brute forcing expose hidden assets.</li><li>Port scanning & service enumeration uncover the digital services in
play.</li><li>Shodan, Censys, and Google Dorks extend your reach beyond what&rsquo;s
visible.</li></ul><p>In hacking, the best payload is useless if you don&rsquo;t know where to point
it, Recon tells you where to aim. Whether you&rsquo;re doing CTFs, bug
bounties, or real-world pentests, never skip recon, it often holds the
keys to the kingdom.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kwesilarry1.github.io/tags/reconnaissance/>Reconnaissance</a></li><li><a href=https://kwesilarry1.github.io/tags/recon/>Recon</a></li><li><a href=https://kwesilarry1.github.io/tags/information-gathering/>Information Gathering</a></li><li><a href=https://kwesilarry1.github.io/tags/webhacking/>WebHacking</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kwesilarry1.github.io/writeups/vulnerable_bank/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How I Hacked A Vulnerable Bank Application</span>
