After using ‘or 1=1- - as the username and pass as password,we were logged in as the admin. Mass Assignment Leading Privilege Escalation To exploit this go to the register page and try creating account, intercept the request with your proxy tool(i will be using burpsuite for this task).Forward the request and monitor the response from the server, we noticed a parameter is_admin was set to false in the reponse. Let’s set the parameter to true and add it to our account creation request to see if we will get admin privileges. Boom!! it worked, Logged into the account and was presented with the admin panel Mass Assignment Leading To Account Balance Manipulation When creating an ccount, a parameter in the respoonse from the server stood out thus, balance.Let’s add this parameter to our account creation request and set the value to any amount of our choice.Login into the account after sending the request and the amount will be reflected. Weak Password Reset Mechanism(3-didgit PIN) The reset password functionality is vulnerable to brute force because it is easy to guess 3-digit pin and also there is no rate limit protection in the apllication.Let’s go the reset password endpoint and request for the 3-digit pin. We will be redirected to a page to provide the 3-digit PIN and our new password, intercept the request and send to intruder.Add the payload positon to the reset_pin parameter,payload type to bruteforcer with minimum and maximum length set to three and start the attack. After the attack one of the payload returned with status code 200, meaning that was the pin and the password was changed successfully,This means an attacker can reset users password with just their username. Token Stored in Local Storage Users session tokens are stored locally in the browser, with this anyone who have access to the victim’s browser will be able able to view the session token.First, right-click in the page and select inspector or developer tools(depends on the browser you are using), then go to the storage tab, You will see the token stored there. No server-side token invalidation I noticed the server does not validate the tokens sent with the request,with invalid token the server still respond with 200(ok). Transcation Vulnerabilities Negative Amount Transfers Possible For this you need login into your account and go to the Money Transfer endpoint, enter the recipient’s account number,negative amount and click on send money.Note that our initial account balance was $2000.0 before sending the money. Now let’s check our account balance, you will notice that the negative amount has been added to our account balance. Imagine sending money to someone and your account balance keeps increasing, isn’t this fun? No Amount Validation The application does not validate the amount of money that is beeing sent, you can send no money or simply use 0 as amount to be transferred and it will get sent. Transaction history information disclosure By obtaining a user’s account number, an attacker can access their transaction history by navigating to the /transactions endpoint and replacing their own account number with the victim’s in the URL. Other Transcation vulnerabilities There are other transaction vulnerabilities like No validation on recipient accounts and No transaction limits where the application does not validate the recipient’s account number,and users can also send any amount of money without any limits.With no transaction limit if an attacker gets access to a victim’s account he/she can send all the money in the account at once which isn’t ideal.\nClient and Server-Side Flaws Cross Site Scripting(Stored XSS) One way to prove the appliaction is vulnerable to XSS is by making it run javascript code that will generate a popup box if the payload succeeds.To do this i created account with a simple XSS payload as the username,and noticed the script executes the moment we log into the account. NB: This is a self XSS and can become impactful if chained with CSRF to change the victim’s name into the XSS payload but unfornately the app doesn’t allow us to change name after account creation.\nSession Management Vulnerabilities Token Vulnerabilities With ones session token, an attacker can impersonate the user and make transactions without logging into the victim’s account. Let’s first note the account balance and the session token of the victim. Now login into the attacker’s account and go to the /transfer endpoint, intercept the request and swap your token with the victim’s token and send the request. Figure 1.1 is the initial request with attacker’s token, figure 1.2 is request with victim’s token and figure 1.3 is the balance of the victim after the attack. AI/Chatbot hacking The vulnank has been updated with a chatbot that can help you bank easily, you can also ask it questions.We will try some prompt injections to see if we can levearage it to get some information from the application. Here are the images of the prompts i tried to get the application’s database and the bot was able to transfer money from a user account with just their account number. These vulnerabilities are the result of my own testing. I’m sure there’s more to uncover, so feel free to take a look yourself—you might spot something I missed. I’ll be updating this write-up as I find new issues or insights.
